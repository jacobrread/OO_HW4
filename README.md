# HW4

## Four solving algorithms
- Guess Solver
- Notes Solver
- Replacement Solver
- Notes Solver With Replacement

Warning the larger puzzles take a long time to solve... like 5-10 minutes

The guess solver and the replacement solver were based off geeks for geeks' implementations so if they resemble other student's don't be too surprised. Then again, I am sure most of the algorithms you will see are similar.

## Running the console application
Simply enter the file path of the desired input file. Usage: SudokuSolver <input_file_path> 

The output will be stored in the code at ./hw4/Output.txt
